# Week 5 - Batch Processing with Spark

Installing local spark seems to be a huge hassle. Will work locally with my existing 3.2.1 spark installation and move on to spark container when working in GCP compute

Most notes are in the jupyter notebook.

Concepts covered

- reading files
- schema enforcement
- repartition to optimize cluster workload
- functions and UDF
